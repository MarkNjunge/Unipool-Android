 # Unipool

Unipool is an carpooling app for Android developed to allow members of Strathmore to have an easier and 
stress free means of coming to the institution.  

The project was submitted to the [Strathmore University](http://www.strathmore.edu/) Faculty of Information Technology as a second year project.

You can find the proposal and documentation in the `docs` folder.
